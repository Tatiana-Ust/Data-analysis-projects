In this project, the situation of marketing analytics of an online store is modeled.

There are initial data for the study: a server log with data on site visits, unloading of all orders, statistics of advertising expenses.

Based on the initial data, a research analysis of the following aspects was carried out:
- user activity (calculating the number of unique users per day, week, month and studying their changes over time; the number and duration of user sessions),
- cohort analysis,
- e-commerce metrics (average amount of time from the first site visit to purchase; average number of purchases per customer; average receipt; LTV),
- marketing metrics (distribution of costs by sources of customer acquisition, CAC, ROMI)
