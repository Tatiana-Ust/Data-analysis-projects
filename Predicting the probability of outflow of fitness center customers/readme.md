The chain of fitness centers develops a strategy for interacting with users based on analytical data.
A common problem of fitness clubs and other services is the outflow of customers.
For a fitness center, we can assume that a client has fallen into an outflow if he has never visited the gym in the last month.
To combat the outflow, the customer service department of the fitness center has converted many user profiles into electronic form.
The purpose of the research is to analyze and prepare an action plan for customer retention.
During the research, the following tasks will be performed:
• predicting the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client;
• formation of typical user portraits: identify several of the most striking groups and characterize their main properties;
• analysis of the main features that most strongly affect the outflow;
• formulation of the main conclusions and recommendations for improving the quality of work with clients.
