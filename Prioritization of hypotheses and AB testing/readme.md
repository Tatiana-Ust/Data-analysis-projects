This project considers A/B testing in the aspect of e-commerce. It is necessary to prioritize hypotheses, conduct an A/B test and analyze the result.
To conduct the research, there are 9 hypotheses available to increase revenue.
To prioritize hypotheses, the ICE method was used, which made it possible to compile a "rating" of hypotheses to increase the organization's revenue.
In conjunction with the A/B test, a cumulative analysis of various indicators was carried out to study the behavior of buyers.
